This program can calculate the total number of cordinates(x,y) 
whose x and y values are even and they lie on the boundary or inside a closed polygon,

INPUT
>first line contains a single integer n(value of n is equal to number of vertices of polygon)
>next n lines contains value of x and y for vertex in a format(x,y)
(NOTE:we can construct polygon by moving from one vertex to other clockwise and input is given in this order)

OUTPUT
>single integer denoting the total number of cordinates with both x and y value even lie inside or on the boundry

TESTCASE
===================
Input
4
-4,-4
-4,4
4,4
4,-4
--------
Output
25
===================
Explanation
it is a square so when we construct this square we get 5 points for x=-4
like(-4,4)(-4,2)(-4,0)(-4,-2)(-4,-4) and so on.
So there are 25 such points.
